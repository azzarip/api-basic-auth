This package enables secure API communication between two Laravel applications using HTTP Basic Authentication.

Install the package on **both applications** that need to communicate.

In your `.env` or `config/services.php`, define the following:

- **Inbound Password**  
  Used to authenticate **incoming** API requests from the other server.

- **Outbound Password**  
  Used when this application sends **outgoing** API requests to the other server.

- **Endpoint**  
  The full URL of the other server (e.g., `https://api.example.com`).


## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require azzarip/api-basic-auth
```

In the `config/services.php` add the following

```php
'username' => [
    'endpoint' => 'http....' //full url for calls
    'inbound_password' => env('INBOUND_PASSWORD'),
    'outbound_password' => env('OUTBOUND_PASSWORD'),
]
```

You can define multiple `username` each of them with endpoint and inbound and outbound password.

## Usage

### Inbound Requests
For the inbound request use the `api.auth` middleware, followed by the username as specified in the config file.
```php
Route::get('/api')->middleware('api.auth:username');
```

This middleware will let all the request with username `username` and password `inbound_password`, as specified in the config files.
## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
